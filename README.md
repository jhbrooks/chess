# chess

Chess implementation in Ruby. The [Final Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/ruby-final-project) in The Odin Project's Ruby Curriculum.

To run the chess program, navigate (via command line) to the directory containing its files, open an irb console, then type "load 'game.rb'", followed by "Game.new.set_up". Due to the size of Unicode chess symbols, it may also be helpful to increase the font size in your command line program, before playing.
